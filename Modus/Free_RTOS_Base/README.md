## Hardware setup

This example uses the kit’s default configuration. See the respective kit guide to ensure that the kit is configured correctly.

**Note:** The AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW920829M2EVB-01) ships with KitProg3 version 2.30 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3 with latest version 2.40. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".
